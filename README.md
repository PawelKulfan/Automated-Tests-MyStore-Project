Hey, welcome to my project of "MyStore" store automated tests.


Project involved preparation set of automated tests for example online store: https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl/index.php?
Test scenarios were:
1.	Register a set number of new users with all required data,
      a.	Numbers of users to create can be set manually,
      b.	Sample user data are given in arrays, script creates users with randomly selected data,
      c.	Script checks, if generated email are not repeated,
2.	Add each user an address with minimum required data.

Tech stack:
Java 20
Selenium + Cucumber
Junit + PageFactory + Gherkin
